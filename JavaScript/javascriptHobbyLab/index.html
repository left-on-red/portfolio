                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>JavaScript is a vast language with many capabilities as you may know. And you may also know that you're mainly meant to write JavaScript for the browser. But JS shall no longer be limited to such restrictions. Imagine JavaScript with all of it's capabilities, but allowed to run outside of the web and as it's own standalone script like you would find with python for example. That is essentially what Node.js is. In addition to this, core functionality is given to the runtime to allow for things that JS wouldn't normally be capable of such as File IO, bindings to native cpp code, and much more.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/">w3schools</a> is an excellent resource for getting your feet wet with Node.js for the first time. It's great at helping you hit the ground running!</li>
                    
                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Mozilla Developer Network</a> is also a really good resource for just JavaScript in general as Node.js is just more feature rich JavaScript. But either way, it's very important to be well versed in JavaScript if you wish to succeed with Node.js</li>

                    <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> isn't exactly a direct source, but whenever you're having trouble in not only JS/Node.js applications, but just anything even remotely related to programming, StackOverflow is usually one of the first results upon googling the aformentioned issue. And the results are usually pretty good. Just be sure to copy the solution, and not the problematic code!</li>
