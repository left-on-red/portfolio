# portfolio

This is a portfolio repository containing all of the code that I've written for every single programming class I have ever taken.

Education:
- North 2016-2020 ([Waukesha North High School](https://sdw.waukesha.k12.wi.us/NorthHS))
- WCTC 2020-present ([Wisconsin County Technical College](https://www.wctc.edu/))

Web I (Intro to the Web I 2016-2017 1st semester @ North) - Mostly pretty generic HTML and CSS stuff.

Web II (Intro to the Web II 2017-2018 2nd semester @ North) - Lots of JavaScript along with more advanced HTML and CSS.

APCSP (AP Computer Science Principles 2017-2018 year long @ North) - Was technically a language neutral class, there's a bit of python. But most of everything was conceptual.

APCSA (AP Computer Science A 2018-2019 year long @ North) - A step up from APCSP. And it was a Java programming class. So all Java.

iOS App Development (App Development I & II 2018-2019 1st and 2nd semester @ North) - Somewhere during my archiving of all these files, I merged them and now I don't know what projects were for which class. But it's all iOS app development with Swift.

Intro to Programming (Intro to Programming 2019-2020 1st semester @ WCTC) - First programming class taken at WCTC, and it's entirely C#

Python (Python Programming 2019-2020 3rd quarter @ WCTC) - As you may have guessed, it's entirely Python

Web Development (Intro to Web Development 2019-2020 2nd quarter @ WCTC) - All general HTML and CSS. Each lab and assignment build upon the previous except for a few exceptions.

C# App Development (Mobile App Development 2019-2020 4th quarter @ WCTC) - All mobile app development with C# and Xamarin.

Dotnet DB (Dotnet Database Programming 2020-2021 1st semester @ WCTC) - All .Net programming (C#) using databases and writing database flexible code.

JavaScript (JavaScript I 2020-2021 2nd quarter @ WCTC) - Mostly JavaScript as I'm sure you could guess. All "raw" JavaScript with DOM manipulation and a little bit of JQuery.

JavaScript 2 (2020-2021 2nd semester @ WCTC) - Advanced JavaScript concepts. Mainly Vue.js framework applications.

Dotnet Web Development (2020-2021 2nd semester @ WCTC) - All C# ASP.NET Web Development.

Introduction to Java (2020-2021 3rd quarter @ WCTC) - All Java Programming.

Software Architecture (2020-2021 4th quarter @ WCTC) - Software design fundamentals and writing structually safe and maintainable code.

Distributed Java (2021-2022 1st quarter @ WCTC) - Java coupled software design
