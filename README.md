# portfolio

This is a portfolio repository containing all of the code that I've written for every single programming class I have ever taken.

Web I (Intro to the Web I 2016-2017 first semester) - Mostly pretty generic HTML and CSS stuff

Web II (Intro to the Web II 2017-2018 second semester) - Lots of JavaScript along with more advanced HTML and CSS

APCSP (AP Computer Science Principles 2017-2018 year long) - Was technically a language neutral class, there's a bit of python. But most of everything was conceptual

APCSA (AP Computer Science A 2018-2019 year long) - A step up from APCSP. And it was a Java programming class. So all Java

App Development (App Development I and II 2018-2019 first and second semester) - Somewhere during my archiving of all these files, I merged them and now I don't know what projects were for which class. But it's all iOS app development with Swift

Intro to Programming (Intro to Programming 2019-2020 first semester) - First programming class taken at WCTC, and it's entirely C#

Python (Python Programming 2019-2020 3rd quarter) - Also taken at WCTC. As you may have guessed, it's entirely Python



### Special Projects

Throughout all my classes, there have been a few projects that I'm especially proud of. These projects are present in their respective class folders, but they also have their own repository on my GitHub.

These projects include:
- pokedex (App Development Final)
- pokemonBattleSimulator (AP Computer Science A Final)
