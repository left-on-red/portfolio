# Using the Postman Collection

There is a collection of Postman requests in the top level project directory. This can be helpful to test your solution.

To use this Postman collection, you will need to define a global
variable with the request mapping of your REST controller (e.g. "api/stockpurchases").

Name your varaible *stockpurchases*.

See this article for details: [Using Variables | Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/)
