<p>If you're looking for an energetic, fun loving dog to adopt, or you want to relinquish a dog, this is your point of contact. The Border Collie Rescue Association is dedicated to finding homes for Border Collies, who, by no fault of their own, find themselves without a family to care for them.</p>
