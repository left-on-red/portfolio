            one thing that I'm not a fan of is that if I pass a value to a component, rather than an actual object, Vue doesn't let me modify it.
            so if I don't want to go through annoying event callbacks, I need to pass this "dialogs" object have each dialog box modify a specific prop to close it

                    now I have a game component. in my first runthrough of this project, I wasn't really aware of how property binding worked with Vue.
                    but now it's really easy to bind information because I can just bind the whole object and render each game component based on that.
                    the only thing that I'm not really sure about now is how I could call either of the dialog boxes from the scope of the component.
                    I was thinking about generating dialog boxes inside each game component, so each game would have access to its own dialog boxes,
                    but I wasn't sure if that was good practice. either way, I'm pretty proud of how much I was able to refactor
